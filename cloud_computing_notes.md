Today, I gained insights into the world of cloud computing, exploring the services and features of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Cloud Computing Platforms

AWS: A cloud computing platform that manages hardware and infrastructure, reducing expenses and complexity.
Azure: A cloud computing service offering a suite of services for building, testing, deploying, and managing cloud-based applications.
GCP: A cloud computing platform providing various services for building, deploying, scaling, monitoring, and operating cloud-based applications.
Origins and Evolution

AWS: Introduced in 2006, supporting open-source concepts.
Azure: Launched in 2009, with a complex relationship with the open-source community.
GCP: Established in 2008, providing managed open-source services.
Service Integration

AWS: Seamlessly integrates services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Beanstalk.
Azure: Effortlessly combines Azure VMs, Azure App Service, SQL databases, and more.
GCP: Combines services like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL.
Availability Zones

AWS: Offers 66 availability zones, with 12 more planned.
Azure: Available in 140 countries, with 54 regions and fewer availability zones.
GCP: Available in 20 global areas, with 73 zones and three more upcoming.
Compute Services

AWS: Offers Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), container services with Docker and Kubernetes.
Azure: Provides Virtual Machines, container services with Azure Container Service.
GCP: Offers Compute Engine with custom machine types, per-second invoicing, and Kubernetes Engine.
Storage Services

AWS: Offers Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Block Storage (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), and relational databases.
Azure: Provides Blob Storage, Queue Storage, File Storage, Disk Storage, and SQL-based databases.
GCP: Offers Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Spanner.
Market Share and Pricing

AWS: Covers 32% of the market, with yearly pricing, and offers spot instances, reserved instances, and dedicated hosts.
Azure: Covers 19% of the market, with minute-based pricing, and offers developers' discounts and hybrid benefits.
GCP: Covers 7% of the market, with minute-based pricing, and offers sustained discounts and preemptible discounts.
Cloud Deployment Models

Private: Single-tenant environment, fully managed by the organization.
Public: Multi-tenant environment, managed by the cloud provider.
Community: Shared environment for organizations with similar interests.
Hybrid: Combination of public, private, or community clouds.
Cloud Computing Service Models

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources.
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications.
SaaS (Software as a Service): Provides software applications over the internet.
